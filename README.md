# Adventure-Game
My first Arduino project.

Uses an Arduino Uno and a Keypad LCD Shield, a common design sold by DFRobot and various vendors on eBay, AliExpress etc. 

This is literally my first Arduino and C++ program. Please be gentle.

Written in 2 days, about 6-8 hours. 

Some stuff hard coded to the 16x2 display but could be fixed to use the declared screen size.
